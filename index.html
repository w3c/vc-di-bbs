This specification describes a Data Integrity Cryptosuite for use when generating
digital signatures using the BBS signature scheme.
The Signature Suite utilizes BBS signatures to provide selective disclosur and
unlinkable derived proofs.

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification defines a cryptographic suite for the purpose of
creating, verifying and deriving proofs using the BBS Signature Scheme in
conformance with the Data Integrity [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] specification. The
BBS signature scheme directly provides for selective disclosure and unlinkable
proofs. It provides four high level functions that work within the issuer,
holder, verifier model. In particular an issuer uses the BBS `Sign` function to
create a cryptographic value known as a "BBS signature" which is used in signing
the original credential. A holder, on receipt of
a credential signed with BBS, then verifies the credential with the BBS `Verify`
function.
      </p>
      <p>
The holder then chooses information to selectively disclose from the
received credential and uses the BBS `ProofGen` function to generate a
cryptographic value, known as a "BBS proof" which is used in creating a proof
for this "derived credential". The cryptographic "BBS proof" value is unlinkable
to the original "BBS signature" and a different, unlinkable "BBS proof" can be
generated by the holder for additional "derived credentials", including those
containing the exact same information.
Finally, a verifier uses the BBS `ProofVerify` function to verify the derived
credential received from the holder.
      </p>
      <p>
To apply the BBS signature scheme to verifiable credentials involves the
processing specified in this document.
In general the suite uses the RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm
[[RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] to transform an input document into its canonical
form. An issuer then uses selective disclosure primitives to separate the
canonical form into mandatory and non-mandatory statements. These are processed
separately with other information to serve as the inputs to the BBS `Sign`
function along with appropriate key material. This output is used to
generate a secured credential. A holder uses a set of selective disclosure
functions and the BBS `Verify` function on receipt of the credential
to ascertain validity.
      </p>
      <p>
Similarly, a holder on receipt of a BBS signed credential uses the RDF Dataset
Normalization Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] to transform an input
document into its canonical form  and then applies selective disclosure
primitives to separate the canonical form into mandatory and selectively
disclosed statements which are appropriately processed and serve as inputs to
the BBS `ProofGen` function. The output of this function suitably processed
becomes the signed selectively disclosed credential sent to a verifier. Using
canonicalization and selective disclosure primitives the verifier can then use
the BBS `verifyProof` function to validate the credential.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
for <a>verification methods</a> and <a>data integrity proof</a> formats.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Verification Methods</h2>
        <p>
The cryptographic material used to verify a <a>data integrity proof</a> is
called the <a>verification method</a>. This suite relies on public key material
represented using [[MULTIBASE]], [[MULTICODEC]], JSON Web Key [[RFC7517]], and [[BLS-JOSE-COSE]].
        </p>

        <p>
This suite MAY be used to verify Data Integrity Proofs [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]
produced by BLS12-381 public key material encoded as a
<a href="#jsonwebkey">JsonWebKey</a>. Loss-less key transformation processes that
result in equivalent cryptographic material MAY be utilized.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Multikey</h3>

          <p class="issue">
This definition should go in the Data Integrity specification and referenced
from there.
          </p>

          <p>
The `type` of the verification method MUST be `Multikey`.
          </p>

          <p>
The `controller` of the verification method MUST be a URL.
          </p>

          <p>
The `publicKeyMultibase` property of the verification method MUST be a public
key encoded according to [[MULTICODEC]] and formatted according to
[[MULTIBASE]]. The multicodec encoding of a BLS12-381 public key that combines
both the G1 and G2 fields is the byte prefix `0xee` followed by the 48-byte G1
public key data, which is then followed by the 96-byte G2 public key data. The
145 byte value is then encoded using base64url with no padding (`u`) as the
prefix. Any other encodings MUST NOT be used.
          </p>

          <p class="advisement">
Developers are advised to not accidentally publish a representation of a private
key. Implementations of this specification will raise errors in the event of a
[[MULTICODEC]] value other than `0xee` being used in a `publicKeyMultibase`
value.
          </p>

    <h2>Algorithms</h2>

The following section describes multiple Data Integrity cryptographic suites
that utilize the BBS Signature Algorithm [[CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE]].
    </p>

    <section>
    <h3>bbs-signature-2023</h3>

    <p>
The `bbs-signature-2023` cryptographic suite takes an input document, canonicalizes
the document using the Universal RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm
[[RDF-CANON]], and then cryptographically hashes and signs the output
resulting in the production of a data integrity proof. The algorithms in this
section also include the verification of such a data integrity proof.

    <h3>bbs-proof-2023</h3>
    <p>
      The `bbs-proof-2023` cryptographic suite takes an input document,
      that has previously been secured using `bbs-signature-2023`,
      derives from this original document a set of messages to be disclosed
      representing a redacted form of the original document, and
      applies the <a data-cite="CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE#name-proofgen">Proof Gen</a>
      algorithm to produce a proof of knowledge for the disclosed messages.
      The result is a new `proof`, containing the following attributes:

        `generators`
