The Signature Suite utilizes BBS signatures to provide selective disclosure and
unlinkable derived proofs.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification defines a cryptographic suite for the purpose of
creating, verifying, and deriving proofs using the BBS Signature Scheme in
conformance with the Data Integrity [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] specification. The
BBS signature scheme directly provides for selective disclosure and unlinkable
proofs. It provides four high-level functions that work within the <i>issuer,
holder, verifier</i> model. Specifically, an issuer uses the BBS `Sign` function to
create a cryptographic value known as a "BBS signature" which is used in signing
the original credential. A holder, on receipt of
a credential signed with BBS, then verifies the credential with the BBS `Verify`
function.
      </p>
      <p>
The holder then chooses information to selectively disclose from the
received credential and uses the BBS `ProofGen` function to generate a
cryptographic value, known as a "BBS proof", which is used in creating a proof
for this "derived credential". The cryptographic "BBS proof" value is not linkable
to the original "BBS signature" and a different, unlinkable "BBS proof" can be
generated by the holder for additional "derived credentials", including any
containing the exact same information.
Finally, a verifier uses the BBS `ProofVerify` function to verify the derived
credential received from the holder.
      </p>
      <p>
Applying the BBS signature scheme to verifiable credentials involves the
processing specified in this document.
In general the suite uses the RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm
[[RDF-CANON]] to transform an input document into its canonical
form. An issuer then uses selective disclosure primitives to separate the
canonical form into mandatory and non-mandatory statements. These are processed
separately with other information to serve as the inputs to the BBS `Sign`
function along with appropriate key material. This output is used to
generate a secured credential. A holder uses a set of selective disclosure
functions and the BBS `Verify` function on receipt of the credential
to ascertain validity.
      </p>
      <p>
Similarly, on receipt of a BBS signed credential, a holder uses the RDF Dataset
Canonicalization Algorithm [[RDF-CANON]] to transform an input
document into its canonical form, and then applies selective disclosure
primitives to separate the canonical form into mandatory and selectively
disclosed statements, which are appropriately processed and serve as inputs to
the BBS `ProofGen` function. Suitably processed, the output of this function
becomes the signed selectively disclosed credential sent to a verifier. Using
canonicalization and selective disclosure primitives, the verifier can then use
the BBS `verifyProof` function to validate the credential.

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <p>
Terminology used throughout this document is defined in the
<a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#terminology">Terminology</a> section of the
[[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]] specification.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming proof</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data model
that complies with the normative statements in this specification. Specifically,
all relevant normative statements in Sections
<a href="#data-model"></a> and <a href="#algorithms"></a>
of this document MUST be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates or consumes a
<a>conforming proof</a>. Conforming processors MUST produce errors when
non-conforming documents are consumed.
        </p>
	<p>
This document contains examples of JSON and JSON-LD data. Some of these examples
are invalid JSON, as they include features such as inline comments (`//`)
explaining certain portions and ellipses (`...`) indicating the omission of
information that is irrelevant to the example. Such parts need to be
removed if implementers want to treat the examples as valid JSON or JSON-LD.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
for <a>verification methods</a> and <a>data integrity proof</a> formats.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Verification Methods</h2>
        <p>
These verification methods are used to verify Data Integrity Proofs
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] produced using BLS12-381 cryptographic key material
that is compliant with [[CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE]]. The encoding formats for these key types
are provided in this section. Lossless cryptographic key transformation
processes that result in equivalent cryptographic key material MAY be used
during the processing of digital signatures.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Multikey</h3>
          <p>
The <a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#multikey">Multikey format</a>, as defined in
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]], is used to express public keys for the cryptographic
suites defined in this specification.
          </p>

          <p>
The `publicKeyMultibase` property represents a Multibase-encoded Multikey
expression of a BLS12-381 public key in the G2 group. The encoding of this field
is the two-byte prefix `0xeb01` followed
by the 96-byte compressed public key data.
The 98-byte value is then encoded using base58-btc (`z`) as the prefix. Any
other encodings MUST NOT be allowed.
          </p>

          <p class="advisement">
Developers are advised to not accidentally publish a representation of a private
key. Implementations of this specification will raise errors in the event of a
[[?MULTICODEC]] value other than `0xeb01` being used in a
`publicKeyMultibase` value.
          </p>

      <h2>Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
The following algorithms describe how to use verifiable credentials with
the BBS Signature Scheme [[CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE]]. When using the BBS signature
scheme the SHA-256 variant SHOULD be used.
      </p>

      <p>
Implementations SHOULD fetch and cache <a>verification method</a> information as
early as possible when adding or verifying proofs. Parameters passed to
functions in this section use information from the <a>verification
method</a> — such as the public key size — to determine function parameters — such
as the cryptographic hashing algorithm.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
When the RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm [[RDF-CANON]] is used,
implementations of that algorithm will detect
<a data-cite="RDF-CANON#dataset-poisoning">dataset poisoning</a>
by default, and abort processing upon detection.

      <h2>Optional Features</h2>
      <p>
The cryptographic properties of BBS signatures permit variants that
can support advanced functionalities. This specification is limited to
supporting only the most relevant of these enhancements, which we explain in the
following sections. The variables |commitment_with_proof|, |use_pseudonyms|,
|pid|, and |pseudonym| are associated with these features and are not otherwise
needed for BBS signatures and proofs.
      </p>
      <p class="issue at-risk" title="Optional BBS features are at risk">
The optional BBS features described in this section, and included in the
algorithms in this specification, are at risk and will be removed before
the finalization of this specification if their respective specifications
at the IETF do not reach RFC status on the same timeline or if there
are not at least two independent implementations for each optional
feature.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Anonymous Holder Binding</h3>
        <p>
This feature binds, at the time of issuance, a document with base proof, to a
secret, known only to a holder, in such a way, that only that holder can generate
a revealed document with derived proof that will verify. For example, if an
adversary obtained the document with base proof, they could not create a revealed
document with derived proof that can verify.
        </p>
        <p>
To provide for this functionality, a holder generates a |holder_secret| value
which should generally be at least 32 bytes long and cryptographically randomly
generated. This value is never shared by the holder. Instead, the holder
generates a commitment along with a zero knowledge proof of knowledge of this
value, using the "Commitment Generation" procedure of [[CFRG-Blind-BBS-Signature]].
This computation involves cryptographically random values and computes
the |commitment_with_proof| and |secret_prover_blind| values. The
|commitment_with_proof| is conveyed to the issuer while the
|secret_prover_blind| is kept secret and is retained by the holder for use
in generation of derived proofs.
Note that a holder can run the "Commitment Generation" procedure multiple times
to produce unlinkable |commitment_with_proof| values for use with different issuers.
        </p>
        <p>
The issuer, on receipt of the |commitment_with_proof|, follows the procedures of
[[CFRG-Blind-BBS-Signature]] to produce a base proof (signature) over the document
with the commitment furnished by the holder. If the issuer chooses to use the
|signer_blind| parameter when creating the signature in
[[CFRG-Blind-BBS-Signature]], this value needs to be conveyed to the holder as
part of the base proof value.
        </p>
        <p>
When the holder wants to create a selectively disclosed document with derived
proof, they use their |holder_secret| (as a "commited message"), the
|secret_prover_blind|, and, if supplied in the base proof, the |signer_blind|
in the proof generation procedure of
[[CFRG-Blind-BBS-Signature]].
        </p>
        <p>
Verification of the revealed document with derived proof uses the "regular" BBS
proof verification procedures of [[CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE]].
        </p>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Pseudonyms with Issuer-known PID</h3>
        <p>
This feature is a privacy preserving enhancement that allows a verifier that has
seen a selectively revealed document with derived proof from a holder to
recognize that the same holder is presenting a new selectively revealed document
with derived proof. Note that this may just be a new unlinkable proof (derived
proof) on the same selectively revealed information. By "privacy preserving," we
mean that no uniquely identifiable information is added that would allow tracking
between different verifiers that may share information amongst themselves. This
variant does allow for the issuer to monitor usage if verifiers share
information with the issuer.
        </p>
        <p>
To furnish this capability, before creating the base proof for a document, an
issuer generates a value known as a |pid| (prover id) which should be
cryptographically random and at least 32 bytes long. This value is shared with
the holder but otherwise kept secret. This value is then used in creating the
base proof via the signing procedure in [[CFRG-Pseudonym-BBS-Signature]].
        </p>
        <p>
The holder receives the document with base proof which includes the |pid| value
from the issuer. The holder obtains a |verifier_id| associated with the verifier
for which they intend to create a revealed document with derived proof. Using the
procedures of [[CFRG-Pseudonym-BBS-Signature]], a cryptographic |pseudonym| value
is generated. The derived proof value is generated via the proof generation
procedure of [[CFRG-Pseudonym-BBS-Signature]], and this value along with the
|pseudonym| are given to the verifier. Note that the |pid| value cannot be
recovered from the |pseudonym|.
        </p>
        <p>
When the verifier receives the revealed document with derived proof and
|pseudonym|, they use the proof verification procedures of
[[CFRG-Pseudonym-BBS-Signature]].
        </p>
      </section>
      <h3>Pseudonyms with Hidden PID</h3>
      <p>
This feature is a privacy preserving enhancement that allows a verifier that has
seen a selectively revealed document with derived proof from a holder to
recognize that the same holder is presenting a new selectively revealed document
with derived proof. Note that this may just be a new unlinkable proof (derived
proof) on the same selectively revealed information. By "privacy preserving," we
mean that no uniquely identifiable information is added that would allow tracking
between different verifiers that may share information amongst themselves and/or
with the issuer.
        </p>
        <p>
To provide for this capability, a holder needs to generate a secret |pid| value
that should be at least 32 bytes long and generated in cryptographically random
manner. The holder then uses the "Commitment Generation" procedure of
[[CFRG-Blind-BBS-Signature]] to generate a |commitment_with_proof| value and
a private |secret_prover_blind| value.
This value needs to be conveyed to the issuer who will use it in the issuance
of a document with base proof, in accordance with
[[CFRG-Pseudonym-BBS-Signature]], which is sent to the holder. The |pid|
value is never shared by the holder. If the issuer chooses to use the optional
|signer_blind| parameter when creating the signature in this value needs to be
conveyed to the holder as part of the base proof value.
        </p>
        <p>
The holder obtains a |verifier_id| associated with the verifier for which
they intend to create a revealed document with derived proof. Using the
procedures of [[CFRG-Pseudonym-BBS-Signature]], a cryptographic |pseudonym|
value is generated from their |pid| value and the |verifier_id|. The derived
proof value is generated via the proof generation using the |pid|,
|secret_prover_blind|, |verifier_id|, and |signer_blind| using the
procedures of [[CFRG-Pseudonym-BBS-Signature]],
and this value is given to the
verifier along with the |pseudonym|. Note that the |pid| value cannot be
recovered from the |pseudonym|.
        </p>
        <p>
When the verifier receives the revealed document with derived proof and
|pseudonym|, they use the proof verification procedures of
[[CFRG-Pseudonym-BBS-Signature]].

(except with negligible probability). Strong unforgeability implies that an
adversary cannot only sign new messages, but also cannot find a new signature
on an old message.
        </p>

        <p>
In [[CDL2016]] under some reasonable assumptions BBS signatures were proven to
be EUF-CMA. Furthermore, in [[TZ2023]], under similar assumptions BBS signatures
were proven to be SUF-CMA. In both cases the assumptions are related to the
hardness of the discrete logarithm problem which is not considered post large
scale quantum computing secure.
        </p>
        <p>
Under non-quantum computing conditions [[CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE]] provides
additional security guidelines to BBS signature suite implementors. Further
security considerations related to pairing friendly curves are discussed in
[[CFRG-PAIRING-FRIENDLY]].

        <h3>Derived Proof Security Properties</h3>
        <p>
The security of the derived proof is dependent on the security properties of
the associated <em>BBS proof</em>. Both [[CDL2016]] and [[TZ2023]] prove that a
<em>BBS proof</em> is <q>a zero knowledge proof of knowledge of a BBS
  signature</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
As explained in [[CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE]] this means:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
a verifying party in receipt of a proof is unable to determine which signature
was used to generate the proof, removing a common source of correlation. In
general, each proof generated is indistinguishable from random even for two
proofs generated from the same signature.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
and
        </p>
        <blockquote>
The proofs generated by the scheme prove to a verifier that the party who
generated the proof (holder/prover or an agent of theirs) was in possession of a
signature without revealing it.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
More precisely, verification of a <em>BBS proof</em> requires the original
issuers public key as well as the unaltered, revealed <em>BBS message</em> in
the proper order.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Selective Disclosure and Data Leakage</h3>
        <p>
Selective disclosure permits a <em>holder</em> to <em>minimize</em> the information
revealed to a <em>verifier</em> to achieve a particular purpose. In prescribing
an overall system that enables selective disclosure, care has to be taken that
additional information that was not meant to be disclosed to the
<em>verifier</em> is minimized. Such leakage can occur through artifacts of the
system. Such artifacts can come from higher layers of the system, such as in
the structure of data or from the lower level cryptographic primitives.
        </p>
        <p>
For example the BBS signature scheme is an extremely space efficient scheme for
producing a signature on multiple <em>messages</em>, i.e.,  the cryptographic
signature sent to the <em>holder</em> is a constant size regardless of the
number of <em>messages</em>. The <em>holder</em> then can selectively disclose
any of these <em>messages</em> to a <em>verifier</em>, however as part of the
encryption scheme, the total number of messages signed by the <em>issuer</em>
has to be revealed to the <em>verifier</em>. If such information leakage needs to
be avoided then it is recommended to pad the number of messages out to a common
length as suggested in the privacy considerations section of
[[CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE]].
        </p>
        <p>
At the higher levels, how data gets mapped into individual <em>statements</em>
suitable for selective disclosure, i.e., BBS <em>messages</em>, is a potential
source of data leakage. This cryptographic suite is able to eliminate many
structural artifacts used to express JSON data that might leak information
(nesting, map, or array position, etc.) by using JSON-LD processing to transform
inputs into RDF. RDF can then be expressed as a canonical, flat format of simple
subject, property, value statements (referred to as claims in the Verifiable
Credentials Data Model [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]). In the following, we examine RDF
canonicalization, a general scheme for mapping a verifiable credential in
JSON-LD format into a set of <em>statements</em> (BBS <em>messages</em>), for
selective disclosure. We show that after this process is performed, there
remains a possible source of information leakage, and we show how this leakage
is mitigated via the use of a keyed pseudo random function (PRF).
        </p>
        <p>
RDF canonicalization can be used to <q>flatten</q> a JSON-LD VC into a set of
<em>statements</em>. The algorithm is dependent on the content of the VC and
also employs a cryptographic hash function to help in ordering the
<em>statements</em>. In essence, how this happens is that each JSON object that
represents the subject of claims within a JSON-LD document will be assigned an
id, if it doesn't have an `@id` field defined. Such <em>ids</em> are known as
<em>blank node ids</em>. These ids are needed to express claims as simple
subject, property, value statements such that the subject in each claim can be
differentiated. The id values are deterministically set per
[[RDF-CANON]] and are based on the data in the document and the
output of a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256.
        </p>
        <p>
Below we show two slightly different VCs for a set of windsurf sails and their
canonicalization into a set of <em>statements</em> that can be used for
selective disclosure. By changing the year of the 6.1 size sail we see a major
change in statement ordering between these two VCs. If the <em>holder</em>
discloses information about just his larger sails (the 7.0 and 7.8) the
<em>verifier</em> could tell something changed about the set of sails, i.e.,
information leakage.

To prevent such information leakage from the assignment of these blank node ids
and the ordering they impose on the <em>statements</em>, an HMAC based PRF is
run on the <em>blank node ids</em>. The HMAC secret key is only shared between
the <em>issuer</em> and <em>holder</em> and each <em>Base Proof</em> generated
by the issuer uses a new HMAC key. An example of this can be seen in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-ecdsa/#example-canonical-hmac-document">
canonical HMAC test vector</a> of [[DI-ECDSA]].
<!-- [canonical HMAC test vector](https://w3c.github.io/vc-di-ecdsa/#example-canonical-hmac-document) of [[VC-ECDSA-SD]]. -->
<!-- <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-ecdsa/#hashmandatorynquads">Section 3.3.17
hashMandatoryNQuads</a> of the [[DI-ECDSA]] specification, passing -->
As discussed in the next section, for BBS to preserve unlinkability we do not
use HMAC based <em>blank node ids</em> but produce a <q>shuffled</q> version of
the ordering based on the HMAC as shown in test vector <a href="#example-canonical-hmac-document"></a>.
Note that this furnishes less information hiding concerning <em>blank node
ids</em> than in the ECDSA-SD approach, since information the number of
<em>blank node ids</em> can leak, but prevents linkage attacks via the
essentially unique identifiers produced by applying an HMAC to blank node ids.

        <h3>Selective Disclosure and Unlinkability</h3>
        <p>
In some uses of VCs it can be important to the privacy of a <em>holder</em> to
prevent the tracking or linking of multiple different <em>verifier</em>
interactions. In particular we consider two important cases (i) <em>verifier to
issuer collusion</em>, and (ii) <em>verifier to verifier collusion</em>. In the
first case, shown in <a href="#verifier-issuer"></a>, a <em>verifier</em>
reports back to the original
<em>issuer</em> of the credential on an interaction with a <em>holder</em>. In
this situation, the <em>issuer</em> could track all the <em>holder</em>
interactions with various <em>verifiers</em> using the issued VC. In the second
situation, shown in <a href="#verifier-verifier"></a>, multiple
<em>verifiers</em> collude to share
information about <em>holders</em> with whom they have interacted.

        <p>
We use the term <em>unlinkability</em> to describe the property of a VC system
to prevent such "linkage attacks"  on holder privacy. Although the term
unlinkability is relatively new section 3.3 of [[NISTIR8053]] discusses and
gives a case study of <q>Re-identification through Linkage Attacks</q>. A
systemization of knowledge on <q>linkage attack on data privacy</q> can be found
in [[Powar2023]]. The most widespread use of linkage attack on user privacy
occurs via the practice of web browser fingerprinting, a survey of which can be
found in [[Pugliese2020]].
        </p>
        <p>
To quantify the notion of linkage, [[Powar2023]] introduces the idea of an
<strong>anonymity set</strong>. In the VC case we are concerned with here, the
anonymity set would contain the <em>holder</em> of a particular VC and other
holders associated with a particular <em>issuer</em>. The smaller the anonymity
set the more likely the holder can be tracked across verifiers. Since a signed
VC contains a reference to a public key of the issuer, the starting size for the
anonymity set for a holder possessing a VC from a particular issuer is the
number of VC issued by that issuer with that particular public/private key pair.
Non-malicious issuers are expected to minimize the number of public/private key
pairs used to issue VCs. Note that the anonymity set idea is similar to the
group privacy concept in [[vc-bitstring-status-list]]. When we use the term
linkage here we generally mean any mechanism that results in a reduction in size
of the anonymity set.
        </p>
        <p>
Sources of linkage in a VC system supporting selective disclosure:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
Artifacts from cryptographic primitives.
          </li>
          <li>
Artifacts from mapping a VC into a set of statements suitable for selective disclosure.
          </li>
          <li>
Artifacts from Proof Options and Mandatory reveal Information in the VC.
          </li>
          <li>
Selectively revealed information in the VC.
          </li>
          <li>
External VC System Based Linkage
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
We discuss each of these below.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>Linkage via Cryptographic Artifacts</h4>
          <p>
Cryptographic Hashes, HMACs, and digital signatures by their nature generate
highly unique identifiers. The output of a hash function such as SHA-256, by its
collision resistance properties, are guaranteed to be essentially unique given
different inputs and result in a strong linkage, i.e., reduces the anonymity set
size to one. Similarly deterministic signature algorithms such as Ed25519 and
deterministic ECDSA will produce essentially unique outputs for different inputs
and lead to strong linkages.
          </p>
          <p>
This implies that <em>holders</em> can be easily tracked across
<em>verifiers</em> via digital signature, HMAC, or hash artifacts inside VCs and
hence are vulnerable to <em>verifier-verifier</em> collusion and
<em>verifier-issuer</em> collusion. Randomized signature algorithms such as some
forms of ECDSA can permit the issuer to generate many distinct signatures on the
same inputs and send these to the <em>holder</em> for use with different
<em>verifiers</em>. Such an approach could be used to prevent
<em>verifier-verifier</em> collusion based tracking but cannot help with
<em>verifier-issuer</em> collusion.
          </p>
          <p>
To achieve unlinkability requires specially designed cryptographic signature
schemes that allow the <em>holder</em> to generate what is called a <q>zero
knowledge proof of knowledge of a signature</q> (ZKPKS). What this means is that
the <em>holder</em> can take a signature from the <em>issuer</em> in such a
scheme, compute a ZKPKS to send to a <em>verifier</em>. This ZKPKS cannot be
linked back to the original signature, but has all the desirable properties of a
signature, i.e., the <em>verifier</em> can use it to verify that the messages
were signed by the <em>issuers</em> public key and that the messages have not
been altered. In addition, the <em>holder</em> can generate as many ZKPKSs as
desired for different <em>verifiers</em> and these are essentially independent
and unlinkable. BBS is one such signature scheme that supports this capability.
          </p>
          <p>
Although the ZKPKS, known as a <em>BBS proof</em> in this document, has
guaranteed unlinkability properties. BBS when used with selective disclosure has
two artifacts that can contribute to linkability. These are the total number of
messages originally signed, and the index values for the revealed statements.
See the privacy considerations in [[CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE]] for a discussion and
mitigation techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
As mentioned in the section on <q>Issuer's Public Keys</q> of
[[CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE]] there is the potential threat that an <em>issuer</em> might
use multiple public keys with some of those used to track a specific subset of
users via <em>verifier-issuer</em> collusion. Since the <em>issuers</em> public
key has to be visible to the <em>verifier</em>, i.e., it is referenced in the BBS
proof (derived proof) this can be used as a linkage point if the <em>issuer</em>
has many different public keys and particularly if it uses a subset of those
keys with a small subset of users (<em>holders</em>).

          <h4>Linkage via VC Processing</h4>
          <p>
We saw in the section on information leakage that RDF canonicalization uses a
hash function to order statements and that a further <q>shuffle</q> of the order
of the statements is performed based on an HMAC. This can leave a fingerprint
that might allow for some linkage. How strong of a linkage is dependent on the
number of blank nodes, essentially JSON objects within the VC, and the number of
indexes revealed. Given <em>n</em> blank nodes and <em>k</em> disclosed indexes
in the worst case this would be a reduction in the anonymity set size by a
factor of <em>C(n, k)</em>, i.e., the number combinations of size <em>k</em>
chosen from a set of <em>n</em> elements. One can keep this number quite low by
reducing the number of blank nodes in the VC, e.g., keep the VC short and
simple.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Linkage via JSON-LD Node Identifiers</h4>
          <p>
JSON-LD is a JSON-based format for serialization of Linked Data. As such, it supports
assigning a globally unambiguous `@id` attribute (node identifier) to each object
("node", in JSON-LD terminology) within a document. This allows for <q>the linking
of linked data</q>, enabling information about the same entity to be correlated.
This correlation can be desirable or undesirable, depending on the use case.
          </p>
          <p>
When using BBS for its unlinkability feature, globally unambiguous node
identifiers cannot be used for individuals nor for their personally identifiable
information, since the strong linkage they provide is undesirable. Note that the
use of such identifiers is acceptable when expressing statements about non-personal
information (e.g., using a globally unambiguous identifier to identify a large
country or a concert event). Also note that JSON-LD's use of `@context`, which
maps terms to IRIs, does not generally affect unlinkability.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Linkage via Proof Options and Mandatory Reveal</h4>
          <p>
In the [[vc-data-integrity]] specification, a number of properties of the
`proof` attribute of a VC are given. Care has to be taken that optional fields
ought not provide strong linkage across verifiers. The optional fields include:
<em>id</em>, <em>created</em>, <em>expires</em>, <em>domain</em>,
<em>challenge</em>, and <em>nonce</em>. For example the optional
<em>created</em> field is a `dateTimeStamp` object which can specify the
creation date for the proof down to an arbitrary sub-second granularity. Such
information, if present, could greatly reduce the size of the anonymity set. If
the issuer wants to include such information they ought to make it as coarse
grained as possible, relative to the number of VCs being issued over time.
          </p>
          <p>
The <em>issuer</em> can also compel a <em>holder</em> to reveal certain
statements to a <em>verifier</em> via the `mandatoryPointers` input used in the
creation of the <em>Base Proof</em>. See section
<a href="#base-proof-transformation-bbs-2023"></a>,
<a href="#example-mandatory-pointers"></a>, and
<a href="#example-json-pointers-and-values"></a>. By <q>compel</q> we mean that
a generated Derived Proof will not verify unless these statements are revealed
to the <em>verifier</em>. Care should be taken such that if such information is
required to be disclosed, that the anonymity set remains sufficiently large.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Linkage via Holder Selective Reveal</h4>
          <p>
As discussed in [[Powar2023]] there are many documented cases of
re-identification of individuals from linkage attacks. Hence the <em>holder</em>
is urged  to reveal as little information as possible to help keep the anonymity
set large. In addition, it has been shown a number of times that innocuous
seeming information can be highly unique and thus leading to re-identification
or tracking.  See [[NISTIR8053]] for a walk through of a particularly famous
case of a former governor of Massachusetts and [[Powar2023]] for further
analysis and categorization of 94 such public cases.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>External VC System Based Linkage</h4>
          <p>
It ought to be pointed out that maintaining unlinkability, i.e., anonymity,
requires care in the systems holding and communicating the VCs. Networking
artifacts such as IP address (layer 3) or Ethernet/MAC address (layer 2) are
well known sources of linkage. For example, mobile phone MAC addresses can be
used to track users if they revisited a particular access point, this led to
mobile phone manufacturers providing a MAC address randomization feature.
Public IP addresses generally provide enough information to geolocate an
individual to a city or region within a country potentially greatly reducing
the anonymity set.

      <h2>Test Vectors</h2>
      <p>
Demonstration of selective disclosure features including mandatory disclosure,
selective disclosure, and overlap between those,
requires an input credential document with more content than previous test
vectors. To avoid excessively long test vectors, the starting document test
vector is based on a purely fictitious windsurfing (sailing) competition
scenario. In addition, we break the test vectors into two groups, based on those
that would be generated by the issuer (base proof) and those that would be
generated by the holder (derived proof).
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>Base Proof</h4>
          <p>
To add a selective disclosure base proof to a document, the issuer needs
the following cryptographic key material:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
The issuer's private/public key pair, i.e., the key pair corresponding to the
verification method that will be part of the proof.
            </li>
            <li>
An HMAC key. This is used to randomize the order of the blank node IDs to avoid
potential information leakage via the blank node ID ordering. This is used only
once, and is shared between issuer and holder. The HMAC in this case is
functioning as a pseudorandom function (PRF).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
The key material used for generating the test vectors to test <i>add base
proof</i> is shown below. Hexadecimal representation is used for the BBS key
pairs and the HMAC key.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Private and Public keys for Signature"
          data-include="TestVectors/BBSKeyMaterial.json"
          data-include-format="text">
          </pre>
          <p>
In our scenario, a sailor is registering with a race organizer for a series of
windsurfing races to be held over a number of days on Maui. The organizer will
inspect the sailor's equipment to certify that what has been declared is
accurate. The sailor's unsigned equipment inventory is shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Credential without Proof" data-include="TestVectors/windDoc.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
In addition to letting other sailors know what kinds of equipment their competitors
may be sailing on, it is mandatory that each sailor disclose the year of their
most recent windsurfing board and full details on two of their sails. Note that
all sailors are identified by a sail number that is printed on all their
equipment. This mandatory information is specified via an array of JSON pointers
as shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Mandatory Pointers" data-include="TestVectors/windMandatory.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The result of applying the above JSON pointers to the sailor's equipment document
is shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="JSON Pointers and Values" data-include="TestVectors/addPointerValues.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Transformation of the unsigned document begins with canonicalizing the document,
as shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Canonical Document" data-include="TestVectors/addBaseDocCanon.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
To prevent possible information leakage from the ordering of the blank node IDs
these are processed through a PRF (i.e., the HMAC) to give the canonicalized HMAC
document shown below. This represents an ordered list of statements that will be
subject to mandatory and selective disclosure, i.e., it is from this list that
statements are grouped.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Canonical HMAC Document" data-include="TestVectors/addBaseDocHMACCanon.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The above canonical document gets grouped into mandatory and non-mandatory
statements. The final output of the selective disclosure transformation process
is shown below. Each statement is now grouped as mandatory or non-mandatory, and
its index in the previous list of statements is remembered.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Add Base Transformation" data-include="TestVectors/addBaseTransform.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The next step is to create the base proof configuration and canonicalize it.
This is shown in the following two examples.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Base Proof Configuration" data-include="TestVectors/addProofConfig.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Canonical Base Proof Configuration" data-include="TestVectors/addProofConfigCanon.txt"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
In the hashing step, we compute the SHA-256 hash of the canonicalized proof
options to produce the `proofHash`, and we compute the SHA-256 hash of the
join of all the mandatory N-Quads to produce the `mandatoryHash`. These are
shown below in hexadecimal format.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Add Base Hashes" data-include="TestVectors/addHashData.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Shown below are the computed `bbsSignature` in hexadecimal, and the
`mandatoryPointers`. These are are fed to the final serialization step with the
`hmacKey`.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Add Base Signing" data-include="TestVectors/addRawBaseSignatureInfo.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Finally, the values above are run through the algorithm of Section
<a href="#serializebaseproofvalue"></a>, to produce the `proofValue` which is
used in the signed base document shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Signed Base Document" data-include="TestVectors/addSignedSDBase.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Derived Proof</h4>
          <p>
Random numbers are used, and an optional `presentationHeader` can be an input,
for the creation of <q>BBS proofs</q>. To furnish a deterministic set of test
vectors, we used the <q>Mocked Random Scalars</q> procedure from
[[CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE]]. The `seed` and `presentationHeader` values we used for
generation of the derived proof test vectors are given in hex, below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="seed and presentation header values" data-include="TestVectors/BBSDeriveMaterial.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
To create a derived proof, a holder starts with a signed document
containing a base proof. The base document we will use for these test vectors is
the final example from Section <a href="#base-proof"></a>, above. The first
step is to run the algorithm of Section <a href="#parsebaseproofvalue"></a> to
recover `bbsSignature`, `hmacKey`, and `mandatoryPointers`, as shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Recovered Base Signature Data" data-include="TestVectors/derivedRecoveredBaseData.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Next, the holder needs to indicate what else, if anything, they wish to reveal
to the verifiers, by specifying JSON pointers for selective disclosure. In our
windsurfing competition scenario, a sailor (the holder) has just completed their
first day of racing, and wishes to reveal to the general public (the verifiers)
all the details of the windsurfing boards they used in the competition. These
are shown below. Note that this slightly overlaps with the mandatory disclosed
information which included only the year of their most recent board.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Selective Disclosure Pointers" data-include="TestVectors/windSelective.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
To produce the `revealDocument` (i.e., the unsigned document that will
eventually be signed and sent to the verifier), we append the selective pointers
to the mandatory pointers, and input these combined pointers along with the
document without proof to the `selectJsonLd` algorithm of [[DI-ECDSA]],
to get the result shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Unsigned Reveal Document" data-include="TestVectors/derivedUnsignedReveal.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Now that we know what the revealed document looks like, we need to furnish
appropriately updated information to the verifier about which statements are
mandatory, and the indexes for the selected non-mandatory statements. Running
step 6 of the
<a href="#createdisclosuredata"></a> yields an abundance of information about
various statement groups relative to the original document. Below we show a
portion of the indexes for those groups.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Derived Group Indexes" data-include="TestVectors/derivedGroupIndexes.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The verifier needs to be able to aggregate and hash the mandatory statements. To
enable this, we furnish them with a list of indexes of the mandatory statements
adjusted to their positions in the reveal document (i.e., relative to the
`combinedIndexes`), while the `selectiveIndexes` need to be adjusted relative to
their positions within the `nonMandatoryIndexes`. These "adjusted" indexes are
shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Adjusted Mandatory and Selective Indexes" data-include="TestVectors/derivedAdjIndexes.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>

          <p>
The last important piece of disclosure data is a mapping of canonical blank node
IDs to HMAC-based shuffled IDs, the `labelMap`, computed according to Section
<a href="#createdisclosuredata"></a>. This is shown below along with
the rest of the disclosure data minus the reveal document.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Disclosure Data" data-include="TestVectors/derivedDisclosureData.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Finally, using the disclosure data above with the algorithm of Section
<a href="#serializederivedproofvalue"></a>, we obtain the signed derived (reveal)
document shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Signed Derived Document" data-include="TestVectors/derivedRevealDocument.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
