      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification defines a cryptographic suite for the purpose of
creating, verifying and deriving proofs using the BBS Signature Scheme in
conformance with the Data Integrity [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] specification. The
BBS signature scheme directly provides for selective disclosure and unlinkable
proofs. It provides four high level functions that work within the issuer,
holder, verifier model. In particular an issuer uses the BBS `Sign` function to
create a cryptographic value known as a "BBS signature" which is used in signing
the original credential. A holder, on receipt of
a credential signed with BBS, then verifies the credential with the BBS `Verify`
function.
      </p>
      <p>
The holder then chooses information to selectively disclose from the
received credential and uses the BBS `ProofGen` function to generate a
cryptographic value, known as a "BBS proof" which is used in creating a proof
for this "derived credential". The cryptographic "BBS proof" value is unlinkable
to the original "BBS signature" and a different, unlinkable "BBS proof" can be
generated by the holder for additional "derived credentials", including those
containing the exact same information.
Finally, a verifier uses the BBS `ProofVerify` function to verify the derived
credential received from the holder.
      </p>
      <p>
To apply the BBS signature scheme to verifiable credentials involves the
processing specified in this document.
In general the suite uses the RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm
[[RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] to transform an input document into its canonical
form. An issuer then uses selective disclosure primitives to separate the
canonical form into mandatory and non-mandatory statements. These are processed
separately with other information to serve as the inputs to the BBS `Sign`
function along with appropriate key material. This output is used to
generate a secured credential. A holder uses a set of selective disclosure
functions and the BBS `Verify` function on receipt of the credential
to ascertain validity.
      </p>
      <p>
Similarly, a holder on receipt of a BBS signed credential uses the RDF Dataset
Normalization Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] to transform an input
document into its canonical form  and then applies selective disclosure
primitives to separate the canonical form into mandatory and selectively
disclosed statements which are appropriately processed and serve as inputs to
the BBS `ProofGen` function. The output of this function suitably processed
becomes the signed selectively disclosed credential sent to a verifier. Using
canonicalization and selective disclosure primitives the verifier can then use
the BBS `verifyProof` function to validate the credential.

      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming proof</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data model
that complies with the normative statements in this specification. Specifically,
all relevant normative statements in Sections
<a href="#data-model"></a> and <a href="#algorithms"></a>
of this document MUST be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates or consumes a
<a>conforming proof</a>. Conforming processors MUST produce errors when
non-conforming documents are consumed.

This document contains examples of JSON and JSON-LD data. Some of these examples
are invalid JSON, as they include features such as inline comments (`//`)
explaining certain portions and ellipses (`...`) indicating the omission of
information that is irrelevant to the example. Such parts need to be
removed if implementers want to treat the examples as valid JSON or JSON-LD.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
for <a>verification methods</a> and <a>data integrity proof</a> formats.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Verification Methods</h2>
        <p>
These verification methods are used to verify Data Integrity Proofs
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] produced using BLS12-381 cryptographic key material
that is compliant with [[CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE]]. The encoding formats for these key types
are provided in this section. Lossless cryptographic key transformation
processes that result in equivalent cryptographic key material MAY be used
during the processing of digital signatures.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Multikey</h3>
          <p>
The <a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#multikey">Multikey format</a>, as defined in
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]], is used to express public keys for the cryptographic
suites defined in this specification.
          </p>

          <p>
The `publicKeyMultibase` property represents a Multibase-encoded Multikey
expression of a BLS12-381 public key in the G2 group. The encoding this field is
the two-byte prefix `0xeb01` followed
by the 96-byte compressed public key data.
The 98-byte value is then encoded using base58-btc (`z`) as the prefix. Any
other encodings MUST NOT be allowed.
          </p>

          <p class="advisement">
Developers are advised to not accidentally publish a representation of a private
key. Implementations of this specification will raise errors in the event of a
[[?MULTICODEC]] value other than `0xeb01` being used in a
`publicKeyMultibase` value.
          </p>
